          <h2>What you share</h2>
          <p>The forms on this site ask for what we need to respond: your name and email, and for some forms a phone number, your program, your school or a message. Grant applications also ask about your plans, an essay and contacts for an instructor and a parent or guardian.</p>

          <h2>Where it goes</h2>
          <p>This version of the website has no server or database. What you enter in a form is saved in your own browser so Foundation staff can review it from the admin dashboard on that device. It is not sent to us over the internet, sold or shared with anyone.</p>
          <p>Donations on this site run in demo mode: no card is charged and card numbers are never stored.</p>

          <h2>Third-party services</h2>
          <p>This site loads no trackers, ads or analytics. The &ldquo;Open in Google Maps&rdquo; link on the <Link href="/contact">contact page</Link> takes you to Google Maps, which has its own privacy policy.</p>

          <h2>Students</h2>
          <p>Student applications are used only to review requests for Foundation support. The Foundation may contact the instructor or guardian listed on the application.</p>

          <h2>Your choices</h2>
          <p>You can clear what this site saved by clearing your browser&apos;s site data. To ask about anything you shared, email <EmailLink />.</p>
